Gianadda
========

Gianadda is a static gallery generator for hikers and bikers. It is named after
the famous [art gallery](http://www.gianadda.ch/) in my home town, Martigny in
the Swiss Alps.

Here are some of it's features:

* Highly automatable
* Customizable with themes
* Easy to use (place you photos in a folder, run Gianadda, and your gallery is
  ready)
* Support of geographic data (GPX tracks, Photo GeoTags, Google maps)
* Generates static pages, meaning that the gallery can be hosted anywhere
* Another benefit of the galleries being static is that pages are fast to load
* Share buttons for the major social networks (facebook, twitter, google+,
  pinterest, etc...)
* Free and Open-source (GPL V3)

To see an example of a gallery generated with the default theme, you can go to
